						<h3>Took a trip to Louisville with the family. While there, I scoped out the shows in town, and settled on Miki's Karaoke Bar. Turns out the Asian food was tasty for dinner. The most amazing thing was that there was no karaoke host for the show. Singers walked up to a tablet & entered their songs.<br/><br/>I started with "Easy" by the Commodores. Then, a couple enjoyed my turn so much, they requested me to sing a few of their favorite R&B hits. It's always fun to meet good folks through appreciation of music!<br/><br/>Kentucky: check!</h3>
